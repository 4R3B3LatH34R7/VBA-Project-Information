# VBA Project Information

From Here on Out, I will share some VBA projects that I created.

I am just starting out on GitHub...so still figuring out how to release something, please bear with me!

I don't actually like/want/wish to apply CC BY-SA license to what I share, really!\
However, there exists some jerks in this world who thought it's ok to derive my work without proper accreditation.\
I don't care much for fame nor finance but a little credit for the many hours of my limited life I spent on a project is appreciated.\
